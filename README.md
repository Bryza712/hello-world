# hello-world
I'm new here, just finding my feet. Thanks

Well! I came here looking to register for the dupeGuru/dupeGuru PE/dupeGuru ME open source projects, so that I could clean up terrabites of jumbled files over multiple harddives I've accumulated over the years. Although, with the leadership having been shuffled from Virgil Dupras to Andrew Senetar, its been a bit confusing where or who to turn to in order to complete said registration.

Although I have VERY limited experience with coding (html/css), I'm not adverse to learning more if its going to benifit the community. The only other thing I have going for me is a logical mind, well adept to toubleshooting and probelm solving, hoping that testing and documention could be of use to someone.

If anyone needs to get in touch, feel free to email me on bryanadams@wn.com.au

Thanks!
